# Notice
I have abandoned this project, as it's not allowed on either VitaDB and/or participate in the 2025 ReiHEN homebrew contest. As such, I'm not going to develop it anymore. Please download data files for PS Vita ports elsewhere.

# PS Vita Data Files Downloader
Downloads data files for PS Vita ports from https://github.com/NFSHubster/PS-Vita-Data-Files

Please do note that I'm not the maintainer of the PS Vita ports list, as such do not ask me any questions about the PS Vita ports (such as if a port is missing from the list)
